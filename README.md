# n17-polyQ


This tutorial explains all steps required to set up the simulations analyzed and discussed in** Conformations of the Huntingtin protein and variations in its aggregate morphology** 

## Create topology and itp files?
1. Create a file called seq.txt containing the sequence of the protein to simultate. For N17 the sequence is xxxx.
2. Use gen_prot.py to create an itp file for the protein. Move this file to the itp folder
3. Create the gro file using the xx script. This will generate a gro file from the supplied seq.txt file. 
4. M
## Add proteins to water box
## Run the steup.py script
